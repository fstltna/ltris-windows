title:  LTris
version: "1.2.3"
summary:  A free Tetris clone that follows the original rules but adds some extras
description: |
   LTris is a tetris clone. Pieces consisting of four blocks are dropping down and need to be stacked in the playing field so that lines get completed. Pieces can be shifted left/right or rotated. Completed lines get removed. The more lines at once the more score you get. When the next piece cannot be placed on top of the playing field the game ends.
