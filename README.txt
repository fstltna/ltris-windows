ltris.exe runs with the current window/fullscreen setting.
Run ltris-fullscreen.bat to switch to fullscreen or
ltris-window.bat to switch to window mode. 
The reason for this is that in windows changing video mode
with SDL fails so it has to be set on start and kept.

Beware, it's an old game. Fullscreen means soft scaling in a 
shadow surface usually for 720p resolution. So it's
neither too fast nor too sharp. Consider it retro...
